It’s inspired by Clues by Sam, but designed to give you a deeper, more immersive experience.
Here are some of the ways it departs from the original:

The grid is now 5 rows × 3 columns, making the game far more comfortable for mobile players.

Every character speaks in a natural, in-world voice, rather than using mechanical template clues.

I'm actively refining the deduction engine to ensure every puzzle is logically sound and fully solvable. I’m also working closely with a growing puzzle-fan community to gather feedback and improve the experience.

So far, I got some positive & negative feedback:

@Dramatic-Mongoose-95: Fun!! Great work, well designed I streamed if you wanna see a stranger play it: <https://m.twitch.tv/videos/2639440872>.
@Slig: I liked it a lot and added to my -DLE directory.
@Wassersuppe: Overall though, I like it! This one could really set itself apart by leaning much heavier into the flavouring, and that could prove to be part of the challenge in some instances. You could have characters early on set up simple world building that hints deeper in the puzzle execute on, things like that. I'm going to keep this one pinned and come back every day to see where this goes :)
@tonygold: This looks like a badly vibe-coded clone of Clues by Sam. The clues are full of this kind of nonsense.
