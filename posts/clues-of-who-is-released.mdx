It’s inspired by Clues by Sam, but designed to give you a deeper, more immersive experience.
Here are some of the ways it departs from the original:

The grid is now 5 rows × 3 columns, making the game far more comfortable for mobile players.

Every character speaks in a natural, in-world voice, rather than using mechanical template clues.

I'm actively refining the deduction engine to ensure every puzzle is logically sound and fully solvable. I’m also working closely with a growing puzzle-fan community to gather feedback and improve the experience.

Enjoy—and let me know what you think!
