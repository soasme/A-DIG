Today’s update adds a **brand-new deduction mechanic** that plays with *alphabetical order*, opening up a fresh dimension of reasoning across rows, columns, and character groupings.

## 🔤 New Clue Type: Alphabet Name Relation  
Starting today, puzzles may include clues like:

> **“Exactly one of the three people whose names come *before mine alphabetically* is a villager.”**

Because character names in Clues of Who are sorted alphabetically, this clue forces you to:

- look *beyond your row*,  
- compare names that might sit **above or below** you on the grid,  
- and trace role patterns based on the alphabetical sequence rather than solely spatial adjacency.

This clue is deceptively simple on the surface, but in practice it creates **long-range deduction threads** that feel totally different from neighbor-based logic.  
Expect puzzles to mix spatial reasoning with name-order reasoning in very fun ways.

## 🛠 Minor Fix: Smarter Late-Game Statements  
Some players noticed that the **final few characters** in a puzzle often had statements that felt like unhelpful fallbacks—things like “I am a villager” or redundant role declarations that didn’t meaningfully aid deduction.

That’s now improved:

- Late-game statements now draw from a **wider, more interesting clue pool**.  
- They won’t all collapse into role-reveal fallbacks.  
- However, they may not always give you direct new deductions — you’ll still need to rely on earlier clues to close the loop.

I’m actively gathering feedback on whether you’d like:  
✨ **an optional second hint** for the final remaining characters, or  
✨ to keep things strictly deduction-pure.

Let me know what you prefer!
