Over the past week, Clues of Who has quietly leveled up again!  
Today’s update focuses on **readability**, **clearer character referencing**, and—most excitingly—**a brand-new clue type** that opens up some truly spicy deduction chains.

## 📏 Text Sized Up for Easy Reading  
A highly requested improvement:  
All puzzle text, character names, and clue blocks have been **scaled up for mobile clarity**.  
No more squinting or pinching to zoom — the entire puzzle is easier to scan at a glance so you can stay in deduction-flow mode.

## 🔍 Clicking Revealed Characters Now Highlights Mentions  
This feature feels small but *massively* boosts usability:

- When you click a revealed character,  
- **Every clue that references that character now lights up**.

This makes backtracking deductions dramatically faster — no more hunting manually through clue blocks to remember who mentioned whom.  
It’s especially useful in late-game puzzles when the clue web gets dense.

## 🧩 New Clue Type:  
### **K of J Role Neighbor Someone Is Another’s Neighbor**

This one is *fun*.

Starting with puzzle **#3**, we’ve introduced a new rule pattern:

**“K of J <Role> neighboring X are also neighbors of Y.”**

This creates deduction paths where you must reason about:

- shared neighbors  
- overlapping adjacency sets  
- roles that appear in constrained geometric patterns  

It adds a richer, more interconnected logic flavor—less “isolated arithmetic,” more “village gossip geometry.”

### 🎯 Example (not from an actual puzzle):  
> “Exactly 2 of the 3 innocents beside Mira are also Leo’s neighbors.”

This forces spatial reasoning in all directions and creates elegant deduction pivots that feel *very* satisfying.

## 🛠 Fix for Directional K-of-J Variants  
We extended the same rule to positional variants:

- K of J role **above** X  
- K of J role **below** X  
- K of J role **left of** X  
- K of J role **right of** X  

To keep clues logically meaningful:

- **K is never 0**, and  
- **the two referenced characters always share at least one neighbor**,  
  ensuring the rule produces real deductions rather than empty conditions.

More improvements are coming — including more Werewolf-style voice clues and deeper mystery-world immersion.
