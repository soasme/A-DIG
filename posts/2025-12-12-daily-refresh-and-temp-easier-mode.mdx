Clues of Who now **refreshes automatically every day at 00:00:00 UTC**, so you’ll always have a new puzzle waiting at a predictable time.

## 🕛 Daily Reset Details
- New puzzle goes live at `00:00:00` UTC every day.  
- Your local reset time depends on your timezone (e.g., UTC-5 = 7:00 PM previous day; UTC+8 = 8:00 AM same day).  
- No manual refresh needed — just open the game after the daily reset.

## ⚙️ Temporary Difficulty Adjustment
I’m still hunting down a **maximum call execution error**. To keep things smooth while I investigate, the **hard difficulty is temporarily toned down**. Once the bug is resolved, I’ll bring the challenge back up and add a couple of fresh twists I’ve been prototyping.

Thanks for the patience — and enjoy the daily rhythm!***
